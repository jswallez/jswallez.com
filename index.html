		<p>I design and code top-notch consumer apps for myself, my friends and millions.</p>

		<h4>About me</h4>
		<p>I recently co-founded my third business: Aria, an app to create professional captioned videos in a snap. We've just closed our seed round and been featured by Apple.</p>

		<p>I’m also Part-Time Director at The Family, helping entrepreneurs build global businesses.</p>

		<p>At 22, I created Noospher, one of the very first e-democracy startup projects in France.</p>

		<p>I then joined Itesoft-Yooz as CMO, an AP company listed on the Euronext stock exchange.</p>

		<p>In 2017, I launched a Messenger's tutoring chatbot called Peter that reached more than half million users. We also developed AR lenses and games that have been played 100 million times and featured during Snap Summit 2019.</p>

		<p>I occasionally do consulting and invest small tickets in 2-3 startups a year.</p>

		<p>At the moment, I'm learning SwiftUI and reading about decentralized finance.</p>
