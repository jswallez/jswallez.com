		<p>I design and code top-notch consumer apps.</p>

		<p class="about">About me</p>
		<p>I recently co-founded my third business: Aria, an app to create professional captioned videos in a snap. We've just closed our seed round and been featured by Apple.</p>

		<p>I’m also Part-Time Director at <a href="https://www.thefamily.co">The Family</a>, helping entrepreneurs build global businesses.</p>

		<p>At 22, I created Noospher, one of the very first e-democracy startup projects in France. I then joined Itesoft-Yooz as CMO, an AP company listed on the Euronext stock exchange.</p>

		<p>In 2017, I launched a Messenger's tutoring chatbot called Peter that reached more than half million users. We also developed AR lenses and games that have been played 100 million times and featured during <a href="https://youtu.be/x4rEtW3gsVU?t=495">Snap Summit 2019</a>.</p>

		<p>I occasionally do consulting and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jean-sebastien-wallez">invest</a> small tickets in 2-3 startups a year. At the moment, I'm learning SwiftUI and reading about decentralized finance.</p>

		<p>Always happy to help.</p>
