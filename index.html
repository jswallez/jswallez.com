	<p class="about">About me</p>

	<p>Currently working on something new, we are VC backed and looking for talented, friendly and ambitious iOS/ML engineers to join the adventure.</p>

	<p>At 22, I created Noospher, one of the very first e-democracy startup projects in France. I then joined Itesoft-Yooz as CMO, an AP company listed on the Euronext stock exchange.</p>

	<p>In 2017, I launched a Messenger's tutoring chatbot called Peter that reached more than half million users. We also developed AR lenses and games that have been played 100 million times and featured during Snap Summit 2019</a>.</p>

	<p>When the pandemic hit, I worked for a year on Aria, an app to create professional captioned videos in no time.</p>

	<p>I occasionally do consulting and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jean-sebastien-wallez">invest</a> small tickets in 2-3 startups a year. At the moment, I'm learning SwiftUI and reading about decentralized finance.</p>
